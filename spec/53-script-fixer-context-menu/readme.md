# Specification: Script Fixer Context Menu (script 53)

> **Status:** Implemented in `scripts/53-script-fixer-context-menu/` as of project version **v0.56.0**. Dual-leaf confirmation prompt + Shift-bypass added in **v0.58.0** (§7.4 + §17). Reusable wrapper extended to script 54 in **v0.59.0** (§7.4.3). This document is the authoritative design contract — any future change to the script must update this spec first.

---

## 1. Purpose

Provide an **opt-in** Windows Explorer right-click cascading submenu titled
**"Script Fixer vX.Y.Z"** that lists every script in this repository, grouped
into categories, and launches the selected script in an elevated PowerShell
terminal.

The menu lowers the activation cost of running repair / install scripts when
they are most needed (Explorer is already open, the user is already
frustrated, and remembering numeric script IDs is friction).

---

## 2. Goals & Non-Goals

### 2.1 Goals

| # | Goal | Acceptance criterion |
|---|------|----------------------|
| G1 | One-click access to every script | Every entry in `scripts/registry.json` appears in the menu, in the correct category |
| G2 | Discoverable version | The top-level label embeds the project version, e.g. `Script Fixer v0.56.0` |
| G3 | Strictly opt-in | Nothing is written to the registry until the user explicitly runs `.
un.ps1 install` |
| G4 | Clean uninstall | `.
un.ps1 uninstall` removes every key created by this script across every scope, in any order, repeatable safely |
| G5 | Idempotent install | Running `install` twice in a row produces an identical registry state (no orphans, no duplicates) |
| G6 | Elevation in one prompt | Each launch shows the UAC shield once and the resulting shell process is already elevated |
| G7 | Self-updating from `registry.json` | Adding a new script + running `refresh` exposes it in the menu without code edits |
| G8 | Visible failure paths | Every registry/file/path failure logs the exact path and reason (CODE RED rule) |

### 2.2 Non-Goals

- **No automatic installation.** Bundle scripts (e.g. script 12) MUST NOT silently install this menu.
- **No DLL / native shell extension.** Pure registry implementation; no compiled component.
- **No Windows 11 modern context menu.** Only the classic context menu (which Win 11 still surfaces under "Show more options"). A future spec may cover the modern menu.
- **No per-user installation.** The menu installs into `HKCR` (machine-wide) only. A per-user variant (`HKCU\Software\Classes`) is out of scope for v1.
- **No GUI.** All interaction is via `.
un.ps1` commands.

---

## 3. Locked-in Design Decisions

These were chosen by the user via clarifying questions and are now contractual:

| # | Decision | Value |
|---|----------|-------|
| D1 | Menu scope | **Everywhere** — files, folders, folder background, Desktop background (4 registry roots) |
| D2 | Categorization source | **Auto** from `scripts/registry.json` with config-driven label map and heuristic fallback |
| D3 | Terminal | **`pwsh` 7+** preferred, fallback to **`powershell` 5.1** |
| D4 | Elevation | **Always elevated** via UAC (`HasLUAShield` value + Windows' built-in `runas` resolution) |
| D5 | Version display | **Top-level label only**: `Script Fixer v{version}` — leaf labels stay short |

---

## 4. Terminology

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Scope** | One of the four shell roots where the menu can appear (file / directory / background / desktop) |
| **Top-level entry** | The cascading parent shown directly in Explorer's right-click menu |
| **Category** | A second-level cascading parent (e.g. "Databases", "Languages & Runtimes") |
| **Leaf** | A clickable terminal launcher whose `command` runs `run.ps1 -I <id>` |
| **Singleton category** | A category that contains exactly one leaf — flattened to the top level so users don't traverse a one-item submenu |
| **Repo root** | The directory containing the top-level `run.ps1` dispatcher (resolved at install time, baked into each leaf's command) |

---

## 5. User Stories

| ID | As a... | I want... | So that... |
|----|---------|-----------|------------|
| US1 | repo user | to right-click anywhere in Explorer and see "Script Fixer v0.56.0" | I always know which version is wired up and can launch any script without a terminal |
| US2 | repo user | hovering "Script Fixer" to expand into "Databases", "Editors & IDEs", … | I can find scripts by intent, not by remembering IDs |
| US3 | repo user | clicking a leaf to open an elevated terminal that runs that script | I get one UAC prompt and immediately see live output |
| US4 | repo user | to opt-out cleanly | I can remove the menu without leftover registry junk |
| US5 | repo maintainer | to add a script and refresh the menu in one command | new scripts surface automatically |
| US6 | repo maintainer | to bump the project version and have the menu label update | the menu always reflects the installed version |

### 6.3 Component responsibilities

| Component | Responsibility | NOT responsible for |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|
| `run.ps1` | Argument parsing, admin assertion, top-level orchestration, summary | Registry I/O, categorization, shell resolution |
| `helpers/categorize.ps1` | Read `registry.json`, apply `categoryMap` then heuristics, sort, flatten singletons | Reading config.json, registry I/O |
| `helpers/shell-detect.ps1` | Locate `pwsh.exe` then fall back to `powershell.exe`, log every miss | Building command lines |
| `helpers/menu-writer.ps1` | All registry create/delete/verify operations | Categorization, shell detection |

---

## 7. Registry Layout

### 7.1 Scopes (D1)

| Scope key   | Top-level path                                                  | Where it appears                |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `file`      | `HKCR\*\shell\ScriptFixer`                                       | Right-click on any file         |
| `directory` | `HKCR\Directory\shell\ScriptFixer`                               | Right-click on any folder       |
| `background`| `HKCR\Directory\Background\shell\ScriptFixer`                    | Right-click empty area in folder|
| `desktop`   | `HKCR\DesktopBackground\Shell\ScriptFixer`                       | Right-click the Desktop         |

Each scope can be toggled independently in `config.scopes.<name>.enabled`. A
disabled scope is **also wiped** at install time (so toggling off + reinstall
removes the menu from that scope).

### 7.2 Cascading parent shape

For every cascading parent (top level + each category):

| Value name    | Type    | Value                               | Why |
|---------------|---------|-------------------------------------|-----|
| `(Default)`   | REG_SZ  | The visible label                   | Required by Explorer for legacy clients |
| `MUIVerb`     | REG_SZ  | Same as `(Default)`                 | Required for owner-drawn cascading menus on Vista+ |
| `SubCommands` | REG_SZ  | `""` (empty string)                 | Documented signal that "I'm a parent — read children from `\shell`" |
| `Icon`        | REG_SZ  | `config.iconPath` (if non-empty)    | Optional polish |

### 7.3 Leaf shape

Each leaf lives at `<parent>\shell\<safeId>` and has:

| Value name      | Type   | Value | Why |
|-----------------|--------|-------|-----|
| `(Default)`     | REG_SZ | `"NN -- pretty-folder-name"` | Visible label |
| `HasLUAShield`  | REG_SZ | `""`  | Renders UAC shield + triggers elevation via `runas` (D4) |
| `Icon`          | REG_SZ | Path to `pwsh.exe` (or override) | Visual cue that this opens a terminal |

And the `command` subkey:

| Path            | Value | Value template |
|-----------------|-------|----------------|
| `<leaf>\command` | `(Default)` | See § 7.4 |

### 7.4 Command line template (dual-leaf, v0.58.0+)

As of **v0.58.0**, every script gets **two** leaves under the same cascading parent:

1. **Default leaf** — runs through `scripts/shared/confirm-launch.ps1::Invoke-ConfirmedLaunch`, which shows a 5-second countdown (Ctrl+C cancels, any key proceeds immediately).
2. **Bypass leaf** — same target, suffix `" (no prompt -- Shift)"`, carries the registry value `Extended=""` so Windows hides it unless the user holds **SHIFT** while right-clicking.

Both templates live in `config.shell` and both ultimately call the shared helper:

```text
# config.shell.commandTemplate (default leaf)
"{shellExe}" -NoExit -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command ". '{repoRoot}\scripts\shared\confirm-launch.ps1'; Invoke-ConfirmedLaunch -RepoRoot '{repoRoot}' -ScriptId '{scriptId}' -ScriptLabel '{leafLabel}' -CountdownSeconds {countdown}"

# config.shell.bypassCommandTemplate (Shift-only leaf -- adds -Bypass)
"{shellExe}" -NoExit -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command ". '{repoRoot}\scripts\shared\confirm-launch.ps1'; Invoke-ConfirmedLaunch -RepoRoot '{repoRoot}' -ScriptId '{scriptId}' -ScriptLabel '{leafLabel}' -Bypass"
```

Placeholders are substituted at install time:

| Placeholder    | Source                                                                  |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `{shellExe}`   | Output of `Resolve-ShellExe` (absolute path)                             |
| `{repoRoot}`   | Resolved at install time from `run.ps1`'s location (parent of `scripts/`)|
| `{scriptId}`   | The numeric ID from `registry.json` (e.g. `52`)                          |
| `{leafLabel}`  | `"NN -- pretty-folder-name"` -- shown in the helper's "Target:" header   |
| `{countdown}`  | `config.confirmBeforeLaunch.countdownSeconds` (default `5`)              |

Rationale for `-NoExit`: keeps the terminal open after the script finishes (or after a cancel) so the user can read the output. Rationale for the dual-leaf shape: discoverability without ceremony — the safety net is the default, the power user holds Shift to skip it.

#### 7.4.1 `confirmBeforeLaunch` config block

```json
"confirmBeforeLaunch": {
  "enabled": true,
  "countdownSeconds": 5,
  "emitBypassLeaves": true,
  "bypassLabelSuffix": " (no prompt -- Shift)",
  "bypassSubkeySuffix": "-NoPrompt"
}
```

| Key | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| `enabled` | Master switch. `false` -> single-leaf legacy mode (direct dispatcher call, no countdown). |
| `countdownSeconds` | Seconds before auto-proceed in the default leaf. `<= 0` is treated as bypass. |
| `emitBypassLeaves` | When `true`, each script gets a Shift-only twin. `false` -> only the default leaf is written. |
| `bypassLabelSuffix` | Appended to the bypass leaf's visible label. |
| `bypassSubkeySuffix` | Appended to the bypass leaf's registry subkey name (kept distinct so the two leaves never collide). |

#### 7.4.2 Shift-to-reveal mechanism

The bypass leaf is written with the registry value `Extended = ""` (REG_SZ, empty). Windows' classic context-menu code path hides any `shell\<verb>` entry carrying that value unless **SHIFT** is held during the right-click. No DLL, no shell extension -- pure registry behavior documented since Vista.

#### 7.4.3 Reuse from other menus (script 54+)

`Invoke-ConfirmedLaunch` (and its sibling `Invoke-ConfirmedCommand` for arbitrary, non-dispatcher commands) is the **single source of truth** for "ask first, then run" across every menu in this repo. Script 54 (VS Code menu installer) opts in via its own `confirmBeforeLaunch` block in `scripts/54-vscode-menu-installer/config.json` -- when `enabled: true`, every "Open with Code" leaf is wrapped in a pwsh call to `Invoke-ConfirmedCommand` with the configured countdown. Disabled by default (v0.59.0) to preserve direct-launch latency.

---

## 8. Categorization Algorithm

Implemented in `helpers/categorize.ps1::Get-ScriptCategorization`.

### 8.1 Inputs

- `scripts/registry.json` — `{ scripts: { "01": "01-install-vscode", ... } }`
- `config.categoryMap` — exact-match lookup (key = stripped folder name, value = category label)
- `config.flattenSingletonCategories` — bool

### 8.2 Per-script category resolution

1. Strip leading `\d+-` prefix from the folder name (`52-vscode-folder-repair` → `vscode-folder-repair`).
2. If the stripped name appears in `config.categoryMap`, use that label.
3. Otherwise fall back to `Get-CategoryFromFolder` heuristic (regex switch by intent).
4. Anything still unmatched falls into `"Other"`.

### 8.3 Sorting & flattening

1. Within each category, items are sorted by **numeric ID** ascending (lexical fallback for non-numeric IDs).
2. Categories are sorted **alphabetically** by display label.
3. If `flattenSingletonCategories` is `true`, every category containing exactly 1 item is removed and its item is appended to a special `_root` group placed **after** the alphabetic categories — these render as top-level leaves directly under the "Script Fixer" parent.

### 8.4 Subkey safety

Category and leaf labels are sanitized via `ConvertTo-SafeSubkey`:

- Strip `\ / : * ? " < > |`
- Collapse whitespace
- Truncate to `config.categorySubkeyMaxLen` (default 60)
- Empty result → `"Item"`

The **visible label** (`(Default)` value) is unchanged; only the **subkey name** is sanitized.

---

## 9. Shell Resolution

Implemented in `helpers/shell-detect.ps1::Resolve-ShellExe`.

### 9.1 Order

1. `Get-Command pwsh` (PATH lookup).
2. Each path in `config.shell.pwshSearchPaths`, with environment variables expanded:
   - `%ProgramFiles%\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe`
   - `%ProgramFiles%\PowerShell\6\pwsh.exe`
   - `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps\pwsh.exe`
3. `config.shell.legacyPath` (`%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`).

### 9.2 Failure behavior

If all candidates miss, install **aborts** with an error listing every path it tried (CODE RED rule).

---

## 10. Commands

Implemented in `run.ps1`.

| Command                    | Behavior |
|----------------------------|----------|
| `.
un.ps1`                | Defaults to `install` (idempotent) |
| `.
un.ps1 install`        | Wipes any prior tree per scope, then writes a fresh tree |
| `.
un.ps1 refresh`        | `uninstall` followed by `install` — recommended after editing `registry.json` or bumping `version.json` |
| `.
un.ps1 uninstall`      | `reg.exe delete /f` for every scope's top key, then purges `.installed/` and `.resolved/` records |
| `.
un.ps1 -Help`          | Prints commands + examples from `log-messages.json` |

Refresh is preferred over manual delete-then-install because it runs both
inside the same admin session and the same logging context.

---

## 11. Idempotency Contract

- **Install**: per-scope wipe (`Remove-MenuTree`) → recreate. Re-running install N times yields the same final registry state as running it once.
- **Uninstall**: per-scope `reg.exe delete /f`. Running uninstall on a system that was never installed returns success without error (logs `wipeNothingToDo` per scope).
- **Refresh**: equivalent to `uninstall && install`, both running under the same admin session.

---

## 12. Versioning Contract

- The top-level label is computed at install time from `scripts/version.json` via `Get-ProjectVersion`.
- The label is **not** dynamically refreshed. Bumping `version.json` requires `.
un.ps1 refresh`.
- If `version.json` is missing or unparseable, the label falls back to `Script Fixer vunknown` and a warning is logged with the exact path that failed.
- The install-time version is also written to `.resolved/53-script-fixer-context-menu/resolved.json` for audit.

---

## 13. Logging & CODE RED Compliance

Every failure logs the **exact path** plus the **exact reason**:

| Failure point        | Path logged                                  | Reason logged                                |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Registry write       | The full `Registry::HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\…` path| Exception message                            |
| Registry delete      | The translated `HKCR\…` path                 | `reg.exe exit <code>` or exception message   |
| Shell detection miss | All searched paths joined by `; `            | "Could not resolve a PowerShell executable"  |
| Missing `version.json`| Full path that was tested                    | "version.json not found"                     |
| Missing `registry.json`| Full path that was tested                  | "registry.json not found -- aborting"        |
| Missing admin        | Current user name                            | "This script must be run as Administrator."  |

All strings live in `log-messages.json` for searchability and i18n readiness.

---

## 14. Configuration Reference (`config.json`)

| Key | Type | Default | Purpose |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `enabled` | bool | `true` | Master switch. When `false`, `install` becomes a no-op (does NOT uninstall) |
| `titleTemplate` | string | `"Script Fixer v{version}"` | Top-level label template; `{version}` is the only placeholder |
| `categorySubkeyMaxLen` | int | `60` | Max length of sanitized subkey names |
| `flattenSingletonCategories` | bool | `true` | Whether to promote single-item categories to top-level leaves |
| `iconPath` | string | `""` | Optional icon for top-level + category parents |
| `shell.preferred` | string | `"pwsh"` | Documentary; resolution order is hard-coded in `Resolve-ShellExe` |
| `shell.fallback` | string | `"powershell"` | Documentary |
| `shell.pwshSearchPaths` | string[] | (3 paths) | Searched in order after PATH lookup |
| `shell.legacyPath` | string | (powershell.exe) | Final fallback |
| `shell.commandTemplate` | string | (see § 7.4) | The `(Default)` value written to each `\command` key |
| `scopes.<name>.enabled` | bool | `true` | Toggle per scope |
| `scopes.<name>.topKey` | string | (per scope) | Registry top key — change at your own risk |
| `categoryMap` | object | (large) | Folder-stripped-name → category label exact-match table |

---

## 15. Failure Modes & Mitigations

| Failure | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| User runs without admin | `Assert-Admin` aborts with a clear message; nothing is written |
| `registry.json` missing | Install aborts before any registry write (logged) |
| `version.json` missing  | Install proceeds with label `Script Fixer vunknown` (warning) |
| No PowerShell found     | Install aborts (no leaves can be wired) |
| Partial install (e.g. 1 scope fails mid-write) | Final summary marks failure; user is told to run `refresh` |
| User edits `registry.json` after install | Menu is stale; `.
un.ps1 refresh` rebuilds it (documented in summary tip) |
| User uninstalls VS Code / a tool | Affected leaf still appears but its inner script handles "not installed" itself; this menu does not pre-validate tool presence |
| User runs an unrelated script that bumps `version.json` | Menu label becomes stale; `refresh` updates it |

---

## 16. Security Considerations

- All leaves run as Administrator (D4). The menu is therefore a **privileged surface** — anyone with write access to `scripts/registry.json` or `run.ps1` can effectively achieve admin code execution from any user who clicks a leaf.
- The repo is assumed to be trusted (cloned by the user, not world-writable).
- No tokens, secrets, or credentials are stored in the registry — only paths and command lines.
- Uninstall removes 100 % of the keys this script created. Nothing is left behind.

---

## 17. Test Plan

### 17.0 Reusable Variables (copy-paste this block first)

All registry checks below use these variables. Change them once to test a different script, category, or scope:

```powershell
# --- Adjustable parameters ---
$SCRIPT_ID      = "52"                              # Change to test different script
$CATEGORY       = "EditorsAndIdes"                # Change to test different category
$LEAF_NAME      = "$SCRIPT_ID-vscode-folder-repair"  # Derived leaf subkey name
$SCOPE_ROOT     = "HKCR:\*"                         # Options: HKCR:\*, HKCR:\Directory, HKCR:\Directory\Background, HKCR:\DesktopBackground

# --- Derived registry paths (do not edit) ---
$MENU_ROOT      = Join-Path $SCOPE_ROOT "shell\ScriptFixer"
$CATEGORY_ROOT  = Join-Path $MENU_ROOT "shell\$CATEGORY"
$DEFAULT_LEAF   = Join-Path $CATEGORY_ROOT "shell\$LEAF_NAME"
$BYPASS_LEAF    = Join-Path $CATEGORY_ROOT "shell\$LEAF_NAME-NoPrompt"

### 17.1 Manual Tests

Manual acceptance checklist (no automated harness — registry side effects):

1. **Install fresh**
   - Run `.
un.ps1 -I 53 install` as admin.
   - Right-click on a file, folder, folder background, and Desktop → menu present in all 4 places.
   - Top-level label matches `scripts/version.json`.
2. **Categories present**
   - "Databases" submenu lists every `install-<dbms>` script, sorted by ID.
   - Singleton categories appear at top level (e.g. one-off scripts), not as one-item submenus.
3. **Leaf launch (default, with countdown)** — v0.58.0+
   - Click a leaf → UAC prompt → terminal opens → header banner appears with `Target` / `Repo` / `Command`.
   - Countdown line "Auto-proceeding in 5s. Press Ctrl+C to cancel, any key to skip." prints.
   - Wait through the full countdown → `run.ps1 -I <id>` runs → terminal stays open after completion.
4. **Leaf launch (skip countdown)**
   - Click a default leaf → press any key during the countdown → "Key pressed -- proceeding now." → script runs immediately.
5. **Leaf launch (cancel countdown)**
   - Click a default leaf → press Ctrl+C during the countdown → "Cancelled by user -- script NOT executed." → script does NOT run, terminal stays open with `-NoExit`.
6. **Shift-bypass leaf is hidden by default**
   - Right-click without holding Shift → only the default leaf for each script is visible (e.g. `52 -- vscode-folder-repair`).
   - The `(no prompt -- Shift)` twin must NOT appear.
   - **Registry verification (using §17.0 variables):**
     ```powershell
     # After defining $SCRIPT_ID, $CATEGORY, $LEAF_NAME, $SCOPE_ROOT and derived paths in §17.0
     
     # Confirm default leaf exists and has NO Extended value
     Test-LeafExists $DEFAULT_LEAF                     # → $true
     Get-ExtendedValue $DEFAULT_LEAF                   # → $null
     
     # Confirm bypass leaf exists (when emitBypassLeaves is true)
     Test-LeafExists $BYPASS_LEAF                      # → $true
     Get-ExtendedValue $BYPASS_LEAF                    # → (Default) property exists with empty value
     ```
   - **Quick reg.exe variant:**
     ```powershell
     reg.exe query "$REG_BASE\shell\ScriptFixer\shell\$CATEGORY\shell\$LEAF_NAME" /v Extended 2>$null
     $LASTEXITCODE  # → 1 (value not found = correct for default leaf)
     
     reg.exe query "$REG_BASE\shell\ScriptFixer\shell\$CATEGORY\shell\$LEAF_NAME-NoPrompt" /v Extended
     $LASTEXITCODE  # → 0 (value exists = correct for bypass leaf)
     ```
7. **Shift-bypass leaf is revealed with Shift**
   - Hold **SHIFT** and right-click → both leaves now appear under the same cascading parent (e.g. `52 -- vscode-folder-repair` and `52 -- vscode-folder-repair (no prompt -- Shift)`).
   - Click the bypass leaf → UAC prompt → terminal opens → "Bypass mode -- proceeding immediately (no prompt)." → script runs without any countdown.
   - **PowerShell programmatic test (using §17.0 variables):**
     ```powershell
     # Re-run the variable block from §17.0, then:
     Get-ChildItem -Path $CATEGORY_ROOT -Recurse |
         Where-Object { $_.PSChildName -like "*$SCRIPT_ID*" } |
         ForEach-Object {
             $hasExtended = (Get-ExtendedValue $_.PSPath) -ne $null
             [PSCustomObject]@{
                 Leaf        = $_.PSChildName
                 Path        = $_.PSPath -replace 'Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\\Registry::HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\', 'HKCR\\'
                 HasExtended = $hasExtended  # $true for -NoPrompt, $false for default
             }
         }
     # Expect: one entry with HasExtended=$false (default), one with HasExtended=$true (bypass)
     ```
8. **Bypass leaf registry shape (regedit walkthrough + reg.exe)**
   - In `regedit`, navigate to any leaf's bypass twin (subkey ends in `-NoPrompt`) → confirm `Extended` value exists, type REG_SZ, value empty.
   - Confirm the default twin does NOT have an `Extended` value.
   - **Command-line verification (using §17.0 variables):**
     ```powershell
     # Check Extended value exists on bypass leaf (exit 0 = success = value exists)
     reg.exe query "$REG_BASE\shell\ScriptFixer\shell\$CATEGORY\shell\$LEAF_NAME-NoPrompt" /v Extended
     $LASTEXITCODE  # → 0
     
     # Check Extended value missing on default leaf (exit 1 = value not found = correct)
     reg.exe query "$REG_BASE\shell\ScriptFixer\shell\$CATEGORY\shell\$LEAF_NAME" /v Extended 2>$null
     $LASTEXITCODE  # → 1
     ```
   - **Strict type + value verification (Extended must be REG_SZ + empty string on bypass leaf, absent on default):**
     ```powershell
     # ---- Bypass leaf: Extended MUST exist as REG_SZ with empty string ----
     $bypassRaw = reg.exe query "$REG_BASE\shell\ScriptFixer\shell\$CATEGORY\shell\$LEAF_NAME-NoPrompt" /v Extended
     # Sample expected output line:
     #     Extended    REG_SZ
     # (no value column = empty string; reg.exe omits it for empty REG_SZ)
     
     $bypassLine = $bypassRaw | Where-Object { $_ -match '^\s*Extended\s+REG_SZ' }
     $hasCorrectType = [bool]$bypassLine                                       # → $true (type is REG_SZ)
     
     # Confirm value is empty: line should have NO trailing content after "REG_SZ"
     $isEmptyValue = $bypassLine -match '^\s*Extended\s+REG_SZ\s*$'           # → $true (empty)
     
     [PSCustomObject]@{
         Leaf            = "$LEAF_NAME-NoPrompt"
         ExtendedExists  = $hasCorrectType    # MUST be $true
         TypeIsRegSz     = $hasCorrectType    # MUST be $true
         ValueIsEmpty    = $isEmptyValue      # MUST be $true
     }
     
     # ---- Default leaf: Extended MUST be completely absent (null) ----
     $defaultRaw = reg.exe query "$REG_BASE\shell\ScriptFixer\shell\$CATEGORY\shell\$LEAF_NAME" /v Extended 2>&1
     $defaultExitCode = $LASTEXITCODE
     $isExtendedAbsent = ($defaultExitCode -eq 1) -and ($defaultRaw -match 'unable to find|ERROR')
     
     [PSCustomObject]@{
         Leaf             = $LEAF_NAME
         ExtendedAbsent   = $isExtendedAbsent  # MUST be $true (reg.exe exit 1 = value not found)
         ExitCode         = $defaultExitCode   # MUST be 1
     }
     ```
   - **Pure PowerShell variant (using `Microsoft.Win32.Registry` for strict type introspection):**
     ```powershell
     # Convert PS-Drive paths to .NET registry sub-key paths (strip "HKCR:\" prefix)
     $bypassSubKey  = ($BYPASS_LEAF  -replace '^HKCR:\\', '')
     $defaultSubKey = ($DEFAULT_LEAF -replace '^HKCR:\\', '')
     
     # ---- Bypass leaf: assert REG_SZ + empty string ----
     $bypassKey = [Microsoft.Win32.Registry]::ClassesRoot.OpenSubKey($bypassSubKey)
     $kind      = $bypassKey.GetValueKind("Extended")     # → String  (REG_SZ)
     $value     = $bypassKey.GetValue("Extended")          # → ""     (empty string)
     $bypassKey.Close()
     
     $kind  -eq [Microsoft.Win32.RegistryValueKind]::String   # → $true
     $value -eq ""                                             # → $true
     $value -is [string]                                       # → $true (NOT $null)
     
     # ---- Default leaf: assert Extended is null ----
     $defaultKey = [Microsoft.Win32.Registry]::ClassesRoot.OpenSubKey($defaultSubKey)
     $defaultVal = $defaultKey.GetValue("Extended", $null)    # → $null (value missing)
     $defaultKey.Close()
     
     $null -eq $defaultVal                                     # → $true (correct: absent)
     ```
9. **Refresh after edit**
   - Add a fake script to `registry.json` (e.g. `"99": "99-test"`).
   - Run `.
un.ps1 -I 53 refresh` → both default leaf and bypass leaf appear for `99`.
   - **Verify with reg.exe:**
     ```powershell
     reg.exe query "HKCR\*\shell\ScriptFixer\shell" /s /f "99-test" | FindStr "99-test"
     # Expect: two lines (default leaf + -NoPrompt leaf)
     ```
10. **Uninstall**
    - Run `.
un.ps1 -I 53 uninstall`.
    - Right-click everywhere (with and without Shift) → menu absent in both states.
    - `.installed/` + `.resolved/53-script-fixer-context-menu/` records removed.
    - **Verify with reg.exe (using §17.0 variables):**
      ```powershell
      reg.exe query "$REG_BASE\shell\ScriptFixer" 2>$null
      $LASTEXITCODE  # → 1 (key not found = successfully removed)
      ```
11. **Idempotency**
    - Run `install` twice in a row → no errors, identical registry state, both leaves intact under each script.
    - Run `uninstall` on a clean system → returns success, logs `wipeNothingToDo`.
    - **Verify no duplicate -NoPrompt suffixes (using §17.0 variables):**
      ```powershell
      reg.exe query "$REG_BASE\shell\ScriptFixer" /s 2>$null | 
          Select-String -Pattern "-NoPrompt-NoPrompt" | 
          Measure-Object | 
          Select-Object -ExpandProperty Count
      # Expect: 0 (no double-suffixed keys from repeated installs)
      ```
12. **`emitBypassLeaves: false` (bypass leaf suppression)**
    - Edit `config.confirmBeforeLaunch.emitBypassLeaves` to `false` → run `refresh` → only default leaves are written; Shift+right-click reveals nothing extra.
    - **Exact PowerShell verification (using §17.0 variables):**
      ```powershell
      # After refresh with emitBypassLeaves: false
      $allLeaves = Get-ChildItem -Path $MENU_ROOT\shell -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
          Where-Object { $_.PSChildName -match "^\d+" }
      
      $defaultLeaves = $allLeaves | Where-Object { $_.PSChildName -notlike "*-NoPrompt" }
      $bypassLeaves  = $allLeaves | Where-Object { $_.PSChildName -like "*-NoPrompt" }
      
      $defaultLeaves.Count   # → N (one per script)
      $bypassLeaves.Count    # → 0 (none emitted)
      ```
    - **Quick leaf-level check:**
      ```powershell
      # After suppressing bypass leaves, only the default leaf should exist
      Test-LeafExists $DEFAULT_LEAF   # → $true
      Test-LeafExists $BYPASS_LEAF    # → $false (bypass leaf not emitted)
      ```
    - **reg.exe batch check:**
      ```powershell
      reg.exe query "$REG_BASE\shell\ScriptFixer" /s 2>$null | FindStr "NoPrompt"
      # Expect: FINDSTR: Line not found (no -NoPrompt keys exist)
      ```
    - **Revert test:** Set `emitBypassLeaves` back to `true` → run `refresh` → both leaf types reappear (idempotent flip).
13. **`confirmBeforeLaunch.enabled: false` (legacy single-leaf mode)**
    - Set `enabled: false` → run `refresh` → exactly one leaf per script, no countdown header, command line dispatches `run.ps1 -I <id>` directly.
    - **Verify command template changed (using §17.0 variables):**
      ```powershell
      # Check the default leaf command directly
      $cmd = Get-LeafCommand $DEFAULT_LEAF
      $cmd
      # Expect: "run.ps1 -I $SCRIPT_ID" directly (no confirm-launch.ps1 in path)
      ```
    - **reg.exe variant:**
      ```powershell
      reg.exe query "$REG_BASE\shell\ScriptFixer\shell\$CATEGORY\shell\$LEAF_NAME\command" /ve
      # Expect: "run.ps1 -I $SCRIPT_ID" directly (no confirm-launch.ps1 in path)
      ```
14. **Failure paths**
    - Rename `version.json` → install logs warning + uses `vunknown`.
    - Rename `registry.json` → install aborts with exact path in error.
    - Run as non-admin → aborts with admin message.
    - Delete `scripts/shared/confirm-launch.ps1` after install → click a default leaf → terminal opens, dot-source line errors out with the exact missing path (CODE RED rule satisfied), terminal stays open.

### 17.2 Testing Across Different Scopes (using §17.0 variables)

To verify the menu appears on folders, backgrounds, or Desktop instead of files, redefine `$SCOPE_ROOT` and re-derive paths:

```powershell
# --- Test on Directory (folders) ---
$SCOPE_ROOT = "HKCR:\Directory"
$MENU_ROOT      = Join-Path $SCOPE_ROOT "shell\ScriptFixer"
$CATEGORY_ROOT  = Join-Path $MENU_ROOT "shell\$CATEGORY"
$DEFAULT_LEAF   = Join-Path $CATEGORY_ROOT "shell\$LEAF_NAME"
$BYPASS_LEAF    = Join-Path $CATEGORY_ROOT "shell\$LEAF_NAME-NoPrompt"
$REG_BASE       = $SCOPE_ROOT -replace '^HKCR:', 'HKCR'

# Now run any test from §17.1 with the new paths
Test-LeafExists $DEFAULT_LEAF   # → $true if installed on folders

# --- Test on Directory Background (empty folder area) ---
$SCOPE_ROOT = "HKCR:\Directory\Background"
# Re-derive $MENU_ROOT, $CATEGORY_ROOT, $DEFAULT_LEAF, $BYPASS_LEAF, $REG_BASE as above...

# --- Test on Desktop Background ---
$SCOPE_ROOT = "HKCR:\DesktopBackground"
# Re-derive paths...
```

**Quick one-liner to test all four scopes at once:**
```powershell
@("HKCR:\*", "HKCR:\Directory", "HKCR:\Directory\Background", "HKCR:\DesktopBackground") | ForEach-Object {
    $regPath = ($_ -replace '^HKCR:', 'HKCR') + "\shell\ScriptFixer"
    $exists = (reg.exe query $regPath 2>$null; $?)  # $true if exit code 0
    [PSCustomObject]@{ Scope = $_; Installed = $exists }
}
```

## 18. Future Extensions (out of v1 scope)

| # | Idea | Notes |
|---|------|-------|
| F1 | Custom `.ico` for top-level + per-category | Add `assets/fixer.ico`; populate `iconPath` |
| F2 | Per-script icons | Extend `categoryMap` from `string` to `{ category, icon }` |
| F3 | Hide disabled scripts | Read each script's `config.json.enabled` and skip when `false` |
| F4 | Per-user installation | Mirror layout under `HKCU\Software\Classes` |
| F5 | Modern Win 11 context menu | Build a packaged sparse-signed shell extension (much larger scope) |
| F6 | Auto-refresh hook on version bump | Tie into a project-wide post-bump task |
| ~~F7~~ | ~~Optional confirmation prompt before launch~~ | **Shipped in v0.58.0** -- see §7.4 / §17. |
| F8 | Logging the launch event | Each leaf could append to `logs/menu-launches.jsonl` before invoking `run.ps1` |

---

## 19. Implementation Pointers

| Want to change... | Edit... |
|-------------------|---------|
| The menu title format | `config.titleTemplate` |
| Which scopes show the menu | `config.scopes.*.enabled` |
| Category names / regrouping | `config.categoryMap` (or extend `Get-CategoryFromFolder`) |
| Singleton flattening behavior | `config.flattenSingletonCategories` |
| The shell that runs each leaf | `config.shell.pwshSearchPaths` / `legacyPath` / `commandTemplate` |
| User-facing strings | `scripts/53-script-fixer-context-menu/log-messages.json` |
| Add a brand icon | Drop a `.ico` somewhere, set `config.iconPath` |

---

## 20. Install Keywords

Recognized by the dispatcher's keyword router:

| Keyword               | Resolves to |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| `script-fixer-menu`   | script 53   |
| `fixer-menu`          | script 53   |
| `right-click-fixer`   | script 53   |

```powershell
.\run.ps1 install script-fixer-menu
```

---

## 21. Prerequisites

- Windows 10 / Windows 11
- PowerShell **5.1+** to run the installer
- **Administrator** privileges
- The repo's top-level `run.ps1` dispatcher (the script bakes its absolute path into every leaf at install time)
- Optional but recommended: `pwsh` 7+ for prettier terminal output

---

## 22. Definition of Done

This script is "done" when **all** of the following hold:
